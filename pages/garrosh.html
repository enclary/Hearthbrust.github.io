<span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> son of <span class="hiddenSpellError">Grommash</span> <span class="hiddenSpellError">Hellscream</span>, to the second opening of the Dark Portal, located in <span class="hiddenSpellError">Outland</span> and took no part in the campaign of his father, he was sent <span class="hiddenSpellError">Kargath</span> <span class="hiddenSpellError">Bladefist</span> when he went to <span class="hiddenSpellError">Nagrand</span> to increase the army,
 calling his people cowards, <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> was saved by Greatmother Geyah from death and learned about the fate of his father.
<br><strong>Formation</strong><br>
Over time, <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> was an outstanding leader of the Mag'<span class="hiddenSpellError">har</span>, and he knew about his father's mistakes,
and tried not to repeat its failures, <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> was most afraid of differences in clan, and with the
arrival of Thrall in <span class="hiddenSpellError">Nagrand</span>, he was able to fully learn the story of his father and see how a hero he was in fact, it aroused in him a high pride of the nation, becoming one of the advisers to Thrall in <span class="hiddenSpellError">Orgrimmar</span> <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> tried
to maintain an aggressive stance, proposing to increase the pressure on its part to an increase in resource extraction in <span class="hiddenSpellError">Ashenvale</span>, but this approach did not approve any <span class="hiddenSpellError">Tral</span> and second counselor Reghar.
At <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span>'s always been a terrible attitude to people and the Alliance, and it intensified after the peace meeting in <span class="hiddenSpellError">Theramore</span>, during which a meeting was attacked <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garona</span> <span class="hiddenSpellError">Halforcen</span> and <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> accused <span class="hiddenSpellError">Varian</span> <span class="hiddenSpellError">Wryyn</span> in this attack, let all then ended peacefully,
but the sediment made <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> boil on rage.
The leader of the <span class="hiddenSpellError">Warsong</span><br> Offensive
Policy Horde under the control of the trawl did not suit <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> for a long time, and while decisions about the battle with the Scourge in <span class="hiddenSpellError">Northrend</span>, <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> called a duel Thrall, and it seemed, would have fought him literally to death, but the attack the soldiers of the <span class="hiddenSpellError">Lich</span> King to <span class="hiddenSpellError">Orgrimmar</span> stopped the duel and they went to defense.
<span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> became the leader of the fortress war in <span class="hiddenSpellError">Northrend</span> and his advisers began to High Overlord <span class="hiddenSpellError">Saurfang</span>, which was once a close friend of his father and helped him not to rash acts, <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garorsh</span> despite plans hordes intensified its pressure on the Alliance in the territory of <span class="hiddenSpellError">Northrend</span> and tried attack them as much as possible,
and to control territory in Grizzly Hills. <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> was trying to control his troops iron-hand and even then it was considered the true embodiment of the spirit of the Horde, he, together with the forces of the horde stormed <span class="hiddenSpellError">Icecrown</span> Citadel.

vspace="5" hspace="5">When the problems started with Cataclysm, Thrall was seriously concerned about the problems with the elements, and joined the circle of the earth, in order to
stop the destruction caused by the awakening of <span class="hiddenSpellError">Deathwing</span>, and <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> became his successor, and it caused discontent of all other races of the Horde, <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> led too aggressive, in the coronation of <span class="hiddenSpellError">Tral</span> presented <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span>,
Bloody howl arms of his late father, and along with that <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> began restructuring <span class="hiddenSpellError">Orgrimmar</span>, in the likeness of those buildings which were in clans of the Horde in <span class="hiddenSpellError">Northrend</span> and <span class="hiddenSpellError">peninsulae</span> <span class="hiddenSpellError">Hellfire</span> aggressive construction of huge reservoirs of iron, aroused hostility and repel each races of the Horde, <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> undermine the peace supply of wood from <span class="hiddenSpellError">Ashenvale</span>, because of what was called in the deadly duel <span class="hiddenSpellError">Cairne</span> leader of the <span class="hiddenSpellError">tauren</span>, but the battle turned out that weapons <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> sent his assistant <span class="hiddenSpellError">Magath</span>, and if no poison, <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> will inevitably be lost in the this fight.
<span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> in his rule applied brutal methods of kidnapping to murder dissatisfied, and the people of the Horde lived only by the grace of <span class="hiddenSpellError">Hellscream</span>, over time <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> more goes crazy and decides to attack <span class="hiddenSpellError">Theramore</span> using rainbow concentration, a magical artifact blue dragons, as catalyst, creating a colossal force <span class="hiddenSpellError">mana</span> bomb, one of a horde of other than the leader of the blood elves do not support this plan, but <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> does not listen to anyone, and attack <span class="hiddenSpellError">Theramore</span>, during the battle, killing all the inhabitants of <span class="hiddenSpellError">Theramore</span>, survived only <span class="hiddenSpellError">Jaina</span> <span class="hiddenSpellError">Proudmoore</span> their ruler, but the explosion injured and it and the thirst for revenge she uses iridescent concentration of the remainder of the <span class="hiddenSpellError">mana</span> bomb, for that would destroy <span class="hiddenSpellError">Orgrimmar</span> and all of its civilians, but Thrall stop in time <span class="hiddenSpellError">Jaina</span> and ended in times of peace between the Horde and the Alliance, the alliance base on the ideals of honor , tore the barbaric rule of <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span>.

<br><strong>Obsession <span class="hiddenSpellError">Sha</span></strong><br>
Since the discovery of the continent of <span class="hiddenSpellError">Pandaria</span>, <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> was interested in resources and artifacts hidden in these uncharted island,
it was not interested in the dangers of <span class="hiddenSpellError">Pandaria</span> he wanted to subdue the
energy <span class="hiddenSpellError">sha</span>, and use it to create a new, more powerful warriors of the Horde,
but little success it originally did not work his soldiers were not able to subdue this energy, he secretly organized <img src="../img/class/garrosh/sha.png" width="420" height="270"

 create a <span class="hiddenGrammarError">"</span>New hordes<span class="hiddenGrammarError">"</span>, while the ranks
 Horde decreased, <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> was not paying particular attention, not yet begun
 a full-scale siege of <span class="hiddenSpellError">Orgrimmar</span> forces of the Horde and the Alliance,
  but at the time, <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> all producing powerful artifacts
	of <span class="hiddenSpellError">Pandaria</span>, and with the help of goblins led <span class="hiddenSpellError">full-scale</span> excavations in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, goblins produced for <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> heart of the ancient god Y'Shaarj, <span class="hiddenSpellError">Taran</span> <span class="hiddenSpellError">Zhu</span> tried to stop him but was defeated, and with the help of the heart <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> defiled energy <span class="hiddenSpellError">Sha</span>, all dollars blossom forever, back in <span class="hiddenSpellError">Orgrimmar</span>, he merged into <span class="hiddenSpellError">eneregiey</span> <span class="hiddenSpellError">postorayus</span> heart and announce martial law of <span class="hiddenSpellError">Orgrimmar</span>, merged with heart He threw the gun his father got a new from Y'Shaarj, but was cast down, the heart was completely destroyed, but the decision was made on three sides that <span class="hiddenSpellError">Garrosh</span> must judge in <span class="hiddenSpellError">Pandaria</span>.

<br><strong>The Warchief of <span class="hiddenSpellError">Draenor</span></strong><br>

Garrosh escapes his trial by receiving help from a friend called Kairozdormu,
 a member of the Bronze Dragonflight who has secret aspirations of his own. They both travel back in time to the Rise of the Horde and stop the Orcs
 from drinking the Blood of Mannoroth. Garrosh helps influence his father, Grommash Hellscream to unite the clans under the banner
  of the Iron Horde in order to get his vengeance.
Uninterested in his goals and no longer needing his help, Garrosh kills
Kairozdormu shortly after arriving on Draenor. He meets with all the leaders of the orc clans of Draenor,
including his own father Grom Hellscream. Using his knowledge of the future and his expertise with weapon and forging technology,
 Garrosh gives the clans the ability to create new, advanced armor and weapons, and reveals to them Gul'dan and the
 Shadow Council's plot to enslave the orcs. On the night of Gul'dan's attempt to have the orcs drink the blood of Mannoroth,
  Grom publicly rejects the blood, prompting Mannoroth to arrive in person and prepare to destroy him for his insolence.
	 Using the new weapons that Garrosh gifted them, the orcs subdue the demon lord long enough for Grom to drive Gorehowl into
	 his skull. With Mannoroth dead, Garrosh unites all the clans under the banner of the Iron Horde, using his lust for vengeance
	 to assist the new and "stronger" Horde in constructing the Dark Portal, permitting him to lead an assault on the present day
	  Horde and Alliance back in Azeroth.

When Grom becomes Warchief of the Iron Horde, Garrosh is granted the mantle
 of Warlord of the Warsong Clan in his father's stead. Taking up residence in Nagrand,<img src="../img/class/garrosh/war4.png" width="380" height="270"
	 alt="Иллюстрация" align="left"
	 vspace="5" hspace="5">
 Garrosh commands his clan from the stronghold of Grommashar, until a party led by
  Yrel or Durotan (including the player) assaults the fortress and attacks Garrosh.
	After a brief fight, Garrosh gains the upper hand and prepares to finish off the party before Thrall arrives,
	 challenging him to a Mak'Gora. Garrosh accepts the challenge, and the two reconvene at the Stones of Prophecy
	  for their final battle. Garrosh claims that all he did, he did for the good of the Horde and to follow and clean up
		 Thrall's actions, but Thrall rejects the notion, claiming that he chose his own destiny. Thrall calls on the power
		  of the elements, trapping Garrosh in a hand of stone and using a strike of lightning to end the former Warchief,
			leaving Garrosh's crushed body and Gorehowl behind at the site of the battle.
